<h2>Jeff Bezos and Amazon</h2>
<p>Jeff Bezos sells 522k of his Amazon shares, which is estimated to be worth $1.3 billion after taxes. Even after selling shares, he still remains the wealthiest man alive with $187.1 billion. He claims to be seeling so much shares at a short period of time because he wants to fund his other projects and bussiness, like the Washington Post and Blue Origin. With this in mind, he will resign as CEO of Amazon and remain chairman in the near future.</p>
